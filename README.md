# Custom Odoo Invoice Report – Indonesian Layout Experiment
This repo documents the analysis-to-implementation process of localizing Odoo invoice PDF output for Indonesian document conventions.

The focus of this project is not only on customization, but on exploring how global ERP outputs can be localized to fit local business document conventions such as:

- Signature space
- Company stamp area
- Amount in words (terbilang)

## Repository Structure

- `docs/` → Thinking process and analysis
- `module/` → Odoo module implementation
- `sample_output/` → Proof that the module works

### Goal

To demonstrate how business document conventions can be translated into ERP report customization through structured analysis and implementation.
