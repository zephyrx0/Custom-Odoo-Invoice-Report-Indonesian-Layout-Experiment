# Observation

From observing various invoice documents circulating in Indonesia, several consistent patterns can be seen:

1. A signature column is almost always present at the bottom of the document.
2. A blank space is reserved for a company stamp.
3. The total amount is frequently written in words (terbilang rupiah).
4. The layout resembles formal printed documents rather than minimal digital reports.

When compared with the default Odoo invoice report, these elements are missing because the report is designed with a global and minimalist layout approach.

This observation led to the idea of exploring how Odoo invoice reports can be adjusted to better resemble commonly used Indonesian invoice documents.
