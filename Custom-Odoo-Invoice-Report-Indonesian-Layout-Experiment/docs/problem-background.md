# Problem Background

Odoo provides a globally standardized invoice report layout designed to fit general business needs across different countries.

However, many invoice documents commonly used in Indonesia — especially by small businesses and companies — include elements that are not present in the default Odoo invoice report, such as:

- Signature space for handwritten approval
- Area for company stamp
- Amount written in words (terbilang) in Indonesian language

This creates a visual and practical gap between the invoice generated by Odoo and the invoice format that is familiar and commonly accepted in Indonesian business practice.

As a result, Odoo implementors in Indonesia often need to repeatedly customize the invoice report to match these expectations.
